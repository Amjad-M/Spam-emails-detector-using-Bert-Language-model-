# Spam detection 

Spam detection is becoming increasingly important in the field of information security. It has been shown that infrequently occurring scams or intrusions into contemporary information systems have resulted in considerable losses when questionable activity was either overlooked or handled inefficiently. Therefore, a lot of work has gone into developing efficient detection techniques before moving on to automating real-time spam identification.
